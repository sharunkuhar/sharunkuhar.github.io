In some rare moments, when a person is truly alone and bored, he/she can become conscious of his anonymity. During an evening cup of caffeine in a cafeteria surrounded by strangers, sometimes one may realize that life is so mundane. All the fun, the sorrows, all the highs and lows, are simply a result of diving into a series of moments forgetting everything else and making one idea, event or individual the focus of our attention. If you stay apathetic to it all, which happens more frequently than anyone is willing to admit, then you find yourself in the middle of nowhere, basically doing nothing.

The feeling I am trying to point out here is the one in which you sit by yourself staring out a glass pane at nothing in particular, trying to pull at different chain of thoughts but each coiling down in front of you uninterestingly as none of them is capable of distracting you at the moment. Then you are left all by yourself, unable to ignore yourself anymore. You grudgingly pick up the topic and start to broaden your vision of your life. It is one of those very few times where you will zoom out of the moment and simply try to find yourself. The realizations in such moments are so crushing that it is just beautiful.

All your flaws float out in front of you, but unlike all other times you accept them with a gloomy face. You figure out what you want in life next and how you are straying far away from the path that you should be treading. In that moment, you are biggest failure that you know — and that is correct, because, although everyone has these feelings sometime or the other, I doubt that life is so sweet that you actually find someone who understands you so intimately that he is able to understand these moods — so, yeah, you are basically the biggest failure that you know. Anyway, your failure leaves a sour taste in your mouth and you explore each of these ideas further — elaborating on your flaws and things that you did wrong.

It is ironic that we crave for company in these moments despite failing to find a single person yet who could sit beside us in that coffee shop and just share the melancholy, without saying a word. No, that won’t happen — this feeling is fundamentally based on solitude and founded upon you as an individual; it cannot and should not be shared. I believe it to be one of the most intimate things about an individual.

There are numerous ways of successfully coming out of this reverie. By the way, I do not condemn this feeling or consider it to be a “bad thing” — I cherish these moments and would encourage anyone to luxuriate in their grief whenever you find yourself in such instances. But, coming out of it successfully means doing something constructive out of the realizations that you see by zooming out. Calling someone that loves you unconditionally (parents, grandparents… partners? I don’t know) is most of the time a good idea. Going on a walk with a song the resonates with your mood playing in your earphones is also good. Singing or playing an instrument is great. Writing a journal is equally great.

You pick up your stuff and leave the coffee shop, thinking about all that is coming up the next day. The gloom leaves you with a different spring in your step. You are relaxed but more focused, you are melancholic but peaceful, you are alone but happier.

No? No one? Just me? Never mind then.
