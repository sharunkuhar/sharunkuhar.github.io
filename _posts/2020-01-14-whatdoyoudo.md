What do you do?

No. Not the common label which your work goes by.

No. Not even the 1–2 sentence explanation.

Imagine answering this to a being from another planet or to a 5-year old. Yes, try answering then. Do not be afraid to follow up a chain of “Why?” after the answer.

Interestingly, the answer starts to shift towards the purpose or meaning behind the work. This super-layman explanation hushes the noise in the chaotic mind like a teacher entering a classroom. The effect is a result of us being out of touch with that purpose. The answer, if we can find it, morphs the work description into a phrase describing value addition.

Although the answer should capture why we do what we do, but it doesn’t seem to quite hit the spot. Seems like the hammer just missed the nail. The true answer to why we do what we do is too cumbersome to be beautiful, and it is a strong subscriber to the belief that truth is always bitter. A person ending up in a particular line of work has to do with circumstances, surroundings, skills (which were discovered), resources, other people’s perceptions …you get the idea.

It is ironic that we have to sit and think about why we do what we do. Or maybe it is not ironic; maybe the cumbersome explanation is not the answer. Maybe the answer is simply “Gotta earn a living — and this is what I ended up doing”. Have to admit, this one has a sort of blunt and rustic charm to itself. Whichever might be the case, one thing is obvious that the answer is not obvious. The follow up to this is then — what motivates us to go about our day and dedicate our energies into our work? It annoys me that money keeps popping up in this chain of thought. Okay, let’s get all Alan-Watts on this one — what would you want to do if money were no object? Wait, never mind, I do not wish for this to get hypothetical.

So, is it really just money that results in us devoting our time and energies into our work? It is one factor but I will reluctantly generalize here and say that this cannot be the entire picture. Other possible contributors are — you are good at it (by popular opinion), you have no other option (by your opinion), this is the best option (money wise… sigh) and you simply enjoy it! Some weirdly specific proportion of these ingredients could construct most people’s answer. These reasons fit the keyhole more easily and sound pragmatic enough to be capable of untangling the knots of existential crisis which hits everyone of us.

Such questions have very individual specific answers… but if the answers of all people were painted onto one single picture, it would be one hell of a yin-yang.
