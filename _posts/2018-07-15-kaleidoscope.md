I sit in my room staring at the ceiling — all white, this light is too bright for me;
Ever closed your eyes without feeling sleepy, a kind of darkness is shrouded in this place — Very similar to a silent EDM, beautiful sounds and screams lie dormant in that darkness, words written in black ink; but what would I know, I can’t see in the dark.

Do you know the difference between black and darkness? Black is black, stays the same even if you shine a torch on it. But darkness… its the most elusive thing I know. Its strange how anything can pierce through darkness except vision. This paints a rather binary view of all ‘this’, but that’s the truth, all the magic happens in the light. The truth hides in darkness and becomes as elusive as itself; maybe that is why there is no ‘one’ truth to anything.

[5 men barged into a household last night][link] and raped a woman of 35 who was living there with her daughter. I don’t know where this thought came from, I just read it in news today morning. Look I do not hold a rather optimistic view of this world and condemn our retched lives from time to time, but such lows are like a punch to the heart in slow motion, a pain somewhere inside escalating with a silent sigh. Those 5 members of our species, later in the night, came back and took the woman away to a nearby religious place and burnt her alive.

This chain of thought has nothing to do with this news incident but I guess I stumbled upon it in the darkness. Huh… On some mornings I look at the mesmerizing blue sky and say to myself ‘its a beautiful day’ — it starts the day on a positive note and I start to notice how beautiful this world actually is, with all the greenery and other bullshit. But what utter ignorance. I read somewhere ‘Ignorance is bliss’, hmm… cannot agree more. A beautiful life, a happy feeling, a good day or whatever positive we know of is an incomplete picture. That’s all it is, an incomplete picture of the truth.

All we do is try and float above the ocean of darkness clinging to this ship of ignorance. Funny thing — each comes out of this ocean and goes back into it!
